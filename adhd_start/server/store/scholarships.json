While some scholarships are based on academic achievement, others have additional criteria. The [Online Engineering Portfolio (ePortfolio)](https://portal.engineering.utoronto.ca/welcome.asp) is a place where you can record your extra-curricular activities and store your resume.\n\nThe Faculty's Scholarships Committee uses the information in the ePortfolio to assist them in selecting recipients for awards that take extra-curricular activities and leadership qualities into consideration and to identify potential candidates for awards outside of the Faculty.\n\nAdditionally, U of T Engineering has scholarships and awards that support Black students, Indigenous students and students registered with Accessibility Services. The ePortfolio provides you with the opportunity to self-identify to be considered for these awards (regardless of extra-curricular involvement) if you would like to do so. While self-identification is not required to complete the ePortfolio, self-disclosure of identity is required to be considered for these specific scholarships and awards.\n\nThe ePortfolio will be turned off at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on June 7 to prepare for scholarship decisions made in mid-July. Don’t delay, complete or update your ePortfolio now!\n\n## U of T Award Explorer\n\n[U of T's Award Explorer](https://awardexplorer.utoronto.ca/) tool can help you explore the diverse U of T funding opportunities that recognize your achievements and financially support your studies.\n\nFor Faculty and departmental scholarships listed in Award Explorer, the “application required” is the completion of the Faculty's ePortfolio; to complete your ePortfolio, visit the [Engineering Portal](https://portal.engineering.utoronto.ca/weblogin/sites",
